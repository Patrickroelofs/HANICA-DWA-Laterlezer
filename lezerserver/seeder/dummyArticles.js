According to one of his attorneys, Washington, D.C.-based Mary Vargas, he weighed about 200 pounds (90.7 kg) when he entered the jail Jan. 30 and 165 pounds (74.8 kg) when he left it Feb. 20.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">In an email, Emily Sheldrick, chief civil deputy with the Clark County Prosecutor&#x2019;s Office, declined to comment on the case, citing county policy. NaphCare did not immediately return an email seeking comment. Last year, the company joined a Virginia jail in agreeing to pay $3 million to the family of a mentally ill man who died after suffering severe weight loss there.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">The lawsuit alleges that Picciano repeatedly asked jail staff verbally and in writing for gluten-free food. At one point, guards told him to trade the gluten-containing food he couldn&#x2019;t eat with other prisoners for food that he could, like bananas. At another, they told him just not to eat anything that would make him sick.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">After nine days with virtually no food, he became unresponsive, the lawsuit said, and guards tried to revive him using the opioid-overdose-reversal drug naloxone.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">&#x201C;Mr. Picciano had not taken drugs or overdosed,&#x201D; the lawsuit said. &#x201C;He had collapsed from not having food.&#x201D;</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">He was taken to a hospital where he was diagnosed with low blood pressure, dehydration, an electrolyte imbalance and an irregular heartbeat. Doctors treated him and sent him back to the jail with orders that he be given a gluten-free diet, but still, the jail failed to do so, the lawsuit said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">The lawsuit accused Clark County and NaphCare of violating Picciano&#x2019;s civil rights, as well as the Americans with Disability Act and state anti-discrimination law.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">It&#x2019;s not the first case alleging a severe outcome after a Washington jail ignored medical dietary needs. In 2012, Michael Saffioti, a 22-year-old man who had turned himself in to face a misdemeanor marijuana 
    charge, died in the Snohomish County Jail after being fed a meal that contained dairy, despite his known, life-threatening allergy.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">At another jail where NaphCare provides medical services &#x2014; the regional South Correctional Entity, or SCORE, in Des Moines, Washington, &#x2014; a 43-year-old mother of five, Damaris Rodriguez, died alone and naked after four days in solitary confinement in early 2018. Police took her into custody after her family called 911 to get her help for a mental health episode, but she never got that help: Lawyers for her family said she was ignored, did not eat, and was found to have fatal ketone and sodium levels. Her entire ordeal was captured on surveillance video in the jail. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">Picciano had recently lost his job as a bricklayer in Vancouver when he and his long-term girlfriend broke up early this year. Devastated and depressed, he threatened suicide and left a shotgun on the dining room table. During an argument about moving back to Michigan, he broke her dresser and for about a minute he kept her from leaving the house, shoving her away from the door, according to charging documents. He was arrested and eventually pleaded guilty to misdemeanors that included unlawful imprisonment and malicious mischief; it was the only time he has ever been arrested, Vargas said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">According to the lawsuit, Picciano informed jail staff when he was booked that he needed a gluten-free diet. The next day he signed a release allowing the jail to access his medical records to prove his celiac disease, an autoimmune condition that can damage the body&#x2019;s intestinal walls and cause long-term health complications. He suffers vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pain if he ingests gluten, and celiac patients can also face long-term problems, such as increased cancer risk, from doing so, the lawsuit noted.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">Even after the jail obtained the medical records, food services personnel repeatedly referred Picciano to medical services at the jail, while medical staff referred him back to food services, the lawsuit said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">He, his family and his lawyer began filing a series of grievances on his behalf. He and his defense lawyer repeatedly told a judge that Picciano wasn&#x2019;t receiving appropriate food; the judge repeatedly asked the 
    prosecutor to find out why; it took until right before Picciano was released for the prosecutor to affirm to the judge that Picciano was finally getting gluten-free food, Vargas said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">Picciano, a member of the Ojibwe Tribe, moved back to the Keweenaw Indian Community in Michigan following his release.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-84 Component-p-0-2-66">Vargas said she is particularly concerned about the Clark County Jail&#x2019;s policy of requiring medical records proving a need before giving prisoners a special diet. It can take days to obtain such records, and prisoners with severe allergies could be in danger in the meantime.</p></div>'`,

    html: `<div><div class="content__article-body from-content-api js-article__body">\n' +
    '<p>An unpleasant sensation at the back of the throat can be a sign that a cold is on the way. But for one Tokyo woman, the cause of the pain was not a sniffle but a live worm that had lodged itself inside one of her tonsils.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Doctors at St Luke&#x2019;s International hospital in the Japanese capital removed the long black worm with tweezers after the patient had complained of throat pain and irritation, according to a <a href="https://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0175" class="u-underline">case study</a> published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.</p>\n' +
    '<aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--not-upgraded">\n' +
    '\n' +
    '</aside>\n' +
    '<p>The worm, which was 38mm (1.5ins) long and 1mm wide, was still alive after being retrieved from the woman&#x2019;s left tonsil, the journal said, adding that her &#x201C;symptoms rapidly improved&#x201D; 
after the procedure.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The worm was identified as a nematode roundworm &#x2013; one of several parasites that can infect people who eat raw fish or meat.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The 25-year-old patient confirmed that she had eaten assorted sashimi five days before the worm was removed.</p>\n' +
    '<p>According to the journal, doctors said the worm was a fourth-stage larva of the worm, adding that the infection had been caused by its younger incarnation as a third-stage larva that was present in her sashimi dish.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The unfortunate diner is not alone. The authors of the study said the number of reported cases had &#x201C;markedly increased worldwide&#x201D; due to the growing popularity of sushi and sashimi.</p>\n' +    '<p>Similar infections are sometimes caused by raw or undercooked meat. Two years ago, a 34-year-old Japanese man became infected by roundworm parasites after eating seared chicken sashimi. He made a full recovery, according to the <a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/casereports/2018/bcr-2018-224492.full.pdf" class="u-underline">British Medical Journal</a>.</p>\n' +
